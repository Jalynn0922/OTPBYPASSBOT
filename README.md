# HOW IT WORKS
When you do a !call (3312345678) Citibank, the OTPBYPASS Bot sends a post request to the api, which will save the call into a sqlite DB and send the call to the custom twilio API.
The Twilio API use our /status route to know what to do in the call, the status route returns TwiML code to Twilio.
The /status route returns the self hosted service song using the /stream/service route.
If the user enter the digit code using the numpad, the song stops, it thanks him for the code, and end the call.
The /status route send the code to your discord channel using a webhook.
